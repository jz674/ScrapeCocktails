# ScrapeCocktails
Used beautifulsoup to  write a simple python script to scrape a site for cocktails

The script can scrape data from the page, more specifically it can extract all the cocktails in 'https://www.liquor.com/hub/cocktail-recipes/#gs.31xJnLc', and will produce a CSV file. The edge cases were not of concern as I wanted to establish the concepts. Instead, a try catch was implemented to escape any edge cases.
